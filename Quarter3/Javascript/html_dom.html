  <h2>HTML DOM & Forms</h2>
  <p>1a.) DOM is the document object model. One is created any time a browser loads a web page. It is constructed as a tree of objects, which include elements like < head > and < body >. </p>
  <p>2a.) The < html > element is the parent node of the < body > element.</p>
  <p>2b.) The child nodes of the < body > element include < a > and < h1 >.</p>
  <p>2c.) The sibling of the < body > element is the < head > element.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
  <h2>Drawing & Animation</h2>
  <p>1a.) < canvas > is used to draw graphics on a web page. Truly, it does not draw the graphics, it contains them, but it is the element that allows it to occur.</p>
  <p>2a.) Specifying the dimensions through CSS only stretches the canvas area instead of defining the coordinate system as that.</p>
  <p>3a.) The canvas context references the pen or focus point on the canvas, somewhat like a turtle in python, though one is limited to one context. It is acquired with canvas.getContext('2d').</p>
  <p>4a.) These can be seen in the game Aversion. There are no rectangles, but given that there is an equilateral triangle, that gives one of the two methods of drawing the rectangle, the other being just to convas.context.fillRect(x1,y1,x2,y2) with (x1,y1) being the upper left corner of the rectangle, and (x2,y2) being the lower right corner.</p>
  <p>5a.) //not done</p>
  <p>6a.) You can clear the canvas by using canvas.context.clearRect(0,0,maxWidth,maxHeight).</p>
  <p>7a.) //not done</p>
  <p>8a.) //eh</p>
  <p>9a.) //mh</p>
