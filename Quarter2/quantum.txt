Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics, or quantum theory) is a
fundamental branch of physics which deals with physical phenomena at nanoscopic
scales where the action is on the order of the Planck constant. It departs from
classical mechanics primarily at the quantum realm of atomic and subatomic
length scales. Quantum mechanics provides a mathematical description of much of
the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and
matter. Quantum mechanics provides a substantially useful framework for many
features of the modern periodic table of elements including the behavior of
atoms during chemical bonding and has played a significant role in the
development of many modern technologies.
